# Selenium_Canvas_Java
The project is created in Selenium+ Java+Maven+ Junit+Cucumber. 
1. It is canvas based page so only one way to get element by clicking on coordinates.
2. For running test . Do right click on TestRunner class and selent Junit. I have recorded vedio for giving clear picture

3. All the numbers kept in config.properties file present in src/main/resources. So without touching test cases anyone can change the data and see the result.
4. Added Report.json in target folder.
